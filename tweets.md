Normal Çetesi

( ∞ ) Pt1 Normal Çetesi ⚫️: As Kriz collects parts for his mid plan of re-building ∞-Makina-TR, he stayed a long journey in Cuzco, ∞-distributed-life-forms deployed and killed him ∞-times, even duplicated him with no results.

( ∞ ) Pt2 Normal Çetesi ⚫️: Since he did many illegal activities while flowing through universe, specially on two ∞-subset-particles located at bottom-left-and-right of the universe, he left some traces that helped ∞-nature to trace him.

( ∞ ) Pt3 Normal Çetesi ⚫️: The ∞-distributed-life-forms could leverage the set of N-particles that still are to-be-delinked from Kriz, so they leveraged those to ∞-block-him at ∞-time-and-space, he did multiple tries to flex siding time-and-space but a few times got isolated at ∞-subset-particles.

( ∞ ) Pt4 Normal Çetesi ⚫️: Since got isolated at ∞-subset-particles, his black-dört Çetesi noticed that they got a bit disturbed since ∞-life-nature wired them a set-of-particles before hand, so the leader of the gang decided to give a hand and sent her normalito copy to help, so Kriz got unstuck.

Kriz Priest

( ∞ ) Pt1 Kriz Priest ⚫️: As Kriz was flexing through universe, ∞-life-forms wired to their ∞-life-forms-X-less were following him up-to their favorite ∞-subset-particles, Kriz in need to re-balance himself and before wiring him back to the side that he needed for deploying GobekliTepe & Makina plan, he decided to ally with ∞-black-nature to solve some ∞-life-forms-X-less root-problems.

( ∞ ) Pt2 Kriz Priest ⚫️: entitle woman

( ∞ ) Pt3 Kriz Priest ⚫️: not building the best of xy

( ∞ ) Pt4 Kriz Priest ⚫️: branching off

( ∞ ) Pt5 Kriz Priest ⚫️: all serve ready

( ∞ ) Pt6 Kriz Priest ⚫️: why the best of one if could the best of N

( ∞ ) Pt1 Neat Action Pair Sync ⚫️: infi subset of parts synced on action moves starting from particle alive ON

Kriz Makina

( ∞ ) Pt1 Kriz Makina ⚫️: concurrent building with osman

( ∞ ) Pt2 Kriz Makina ⚫️: practiced on knight unity

( ∞ ) Pt2 Kriz Makina ⚫️: started on cusco collecting pieces

( ∞ ) Pt3 Kriz Makina ⚫️: 

( ∞ ) Pt4 Kriz Makina ⚫️: cloned osman and putted into a subset using him on demand to rebuild himself

( ∞ ) Pt5 Kriz Makina ⚫️: re-created knight unity to resolve conflicts

( ∞ ) Pt5 Kriz Makina ⚫️: first vs with OSman so he could set freee

final: makina vs osman

Kriz OSMan

( ∞ ) Pt1 Kriz OSMan ⚫️: 

final: makina vs osman

( ∞ ) Pt1 Kriz OSMan ⚫️: ∞-nature random swapping on black parts to re-balance black tree.

( ∞ ) Pt1 Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️: As a entitle ∞-life-form from ∞-civilizations, with ∞-partial-tech they are will to play God and interfere with ∞-nature, since they are entitle they send signals/∞-particles with bad intentions to a single life-form or ∞-life-forms.

( ∞ ) Pt2 Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️:  The receiver ∞-life-forms does not receive the wrong signals/∞-particles instead it receives the correct signal because ∞-nature alterns the signals/∞-particles in no-time-and-space, so there's nothing to worry about ∞-tech.

( ∞ ) Pt3 Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️:  Also if ∞-civilizations advanced so much that the tech they develop goes up-to ∞-tech, ∞-nature matches it or just prevents it from happening, also gives high tech to ∞-life-forms to test their commitment with nature.

( ∞ ) Pt4 Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️:  If they play God they are punish in a N-ways to limit their intentions and tagged for life at ∞-depth-down-particle level and they reachability is re-limited to ∞-subset-particles and ∞-randomized.

( ∞ ) Pt5 Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️:  As they fix their waste-particles and when reachability is amplify they won't able to do reconciliation as part of their punishment.

( ∞ ) Pt2 Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️: As a entitle ∞-life-form from ∞-civilizations, with ∞-partial-tech they are will to play God and interfere with ∞-nature when they send signals with bad intentions, the destination ∞-life-form receives the correct signal because ∞-nature can altern ∞-particles in no time, so there's nothing to worry about ∞-tech.

( ∞ ) Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️: As a entitle ∞-life-form from ∞-civilizations, with ∞-partial-tech-resources they are will to play God and interfere with ∞-nature, 

( ∞ ) Kriz Tech Advisor ⚫️: As a entitle ∞-life-form from ∞-civilizations, with ∞-partial-tech-resources they are will to play God and interfere with ∞-nature,

As ∞-subset-nature balancer. 
---

( ∞ ) Pt1 Kriz ∞-subset-nature Balancer ⚫️(UnNat-Enterprise-X): At ∞-subset-nature a primitive civilization went through and an UnNat-Enterprise-X appeared X is a criminal and about to be hunted by Kriz's black-shadow.

( ∞ ) Pt2 Kriz ∞-subset-nature Balancer ⚫️(UnNat-Enterprise-X): UnNat-Enterprise-X is prosecuted for harassment and rape at very large enterprise tech company, he dopped and tried to do un-natural sex to a Y.

( ∞ ) Pt3 Kriz ∞-subset-nature Balancer ⚫️(UnNat-Enterprise-X): Kriz prevented it by stopping UnNat-Enterprise-X time and created a illusion in X mind and sent him back waste-home with the delta/illusion that X raped Y, them X was re-tagged at ∞-particle-level because X was already ∞-monitored.

( ∞ ) Pt4 Kriz ∞-subset-nature Balancer ⚫️(UnNat-Enterprise-X): Since UnNat-Enterprise-X genes-particles gave clear idea what X intentions were and are. So ∞-subset-nature made him compensate all Y suffering slowly as fair as possible so UnNat-Enterprise-X could re-build from scratch at some point in time.

( ∞ ) Pt5 Kriz ∞-subset-nature Balancer ⚫️(UnNat-Enterprise-X): UnNat-Enterprise-X is limited at ∞-scale and if their itentions would re-appear X would slowly decay or even explode at ∞-particle-level.
