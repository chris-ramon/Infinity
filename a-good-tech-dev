# A good tech dev

- I create value writting code in open-source projects.
- I eespect the wife of others tech devs.
- I always write code in good-faith, I evaluate the impact and the changes must be inline with preserving life by considering ethics.
- I respect other jobs and remain humble and also recognize their good work.
