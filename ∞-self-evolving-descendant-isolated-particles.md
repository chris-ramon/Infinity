In ∞-universe a ∞-self-evolving-descendant-isolated-particles is a isolated set of particles that self evolve as the ∞-life-forms swaps their fractal-particles leaving those that causes all kind of de-generations for their upcoming descendants.

The isolated particles reflects the ∞-life-forms-XY current state of particles, each fractal-particle is wired to a ∞-partial-particles being the main ones:

∞-life-path, those particles are collected as the XY flows throw ∞-universe, most of them are left behind naturally, but many of them remain wired due to certain +-deltas to addressed once ∞-universe decides to.

∞-family-path, those particles are fractally wired from the beginning of XY life, as XY grows the set of particles are callibrated based on their life actions, main events trigger swaps of entire particles specially for Y because without them the ∞-universe would lose life.

The **∞-**self-evolving-descendant-isolated-particles wires all previous paths plus the ∞-particles that the universe decides to which are based on purity into ∞-temps-swapping-particles that guide the XY through their process of becoming descendants.

The ∞-temps-swapping-particles are wired to any part of the descendant-isolated(home on earth), the particles flow through all the home, echoing/signaling 24/7 to the XY to reach their best, on miss-alignment the ∞-life-forms-XY particles are callibrated accordingly such as:

- Nature syncing.
- Perplexity.
- Friendly reminders.
- illnessess.
- Mad on-demand.
- Divide and perpetual punishment.
- Swap.
- And all different adjustments at particle level.

The **∞-**self-evolving-descendant-isolated-particles is aligned with the universe, matching their current state of particles, all to preserve life, all other particles such as tech become irrelevant just tools for the life-forms to have a decent life.
