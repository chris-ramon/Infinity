## ∞-particles-fi-derivatives


Each particle could be wired to an finance derivative, which could have a set of owners:

## How it could work

### Proposal One

1 particle →N finance-derivatives.

N finance-derivatives →N owners.

---

$10 for Y - I'll pay $10 in 10 years.

- Buy forwards Y increasing beyond $10.
- Sell forwards Y decreasing below $10.

Thing is, an agreement is set Y -> $10, I **buy/sell the agreement** ahead at any price because price could change.

Particle as fractal, them particle-part-N set to each agreement.

Each agreement could traverse particle in-depth and agreements flow through as buy/sell changes.

Not similar than ∞-law-agreements because on law-agreement agreement is map to a particle, but

Here we set each derivative agreement to 

On each agreement change owner, not because here each particle represents a derivative agreement.

A set of N particles could be wired up-to inert part, similar than GitHub storing info in the Antartic.

Similar set of N particles could be wired to store derivatives, key difference being fractals/graphs 

when changing owner.
