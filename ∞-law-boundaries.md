∞-law-agreements

Particles are better described as an ∞-fractals, when ∞-life-forms are wired to universe, each ∞-partial-particles are part of a ∞-law-agreements(At this level, each agreement are set to set-of-boundaries between N set of ∞-particles) the agreements are set at any ∞-fractal-depth and stamped at each ∞-particle.

Each ∞-law-agreement applies both as a fractal based and graph based.

## How it could work

### Proposal One

1 partial-particle →N law-agreements.

1 law-agreement → 1 law-boundary → N law-sub-boundaries.
