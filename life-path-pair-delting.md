# **Life Path Pair Delting**

# ∞ temp life-forms swapping in no-time which guides the XY pairing in favor of the upcoming new set of life-forms, being the final outcome the resolution of XY deltas.

Also ∞-parts as-set of patches are set to the XY life-forms in order to pay the deltas generated through their life path, also as way to calibrate their ancestors life path in favor of preserving the life nature balance.

The set of ∞-parts generated via the XY pairing which are the outcome from the pairing represented as a resolved and consolidated △, those are used when XY concrete the pairing by hitting life layer.

Is confirmed that each species has ∞-mutations, and those are calibrated in the pairing process, ∞-parts are echoed ∞tly to balance life nature.

Each life-form has a ∞-parts that ∞-slide/∞-flex through time & space, those mutations affect the balance of life nature, on pairing process those are detected and tagged, prevented for expanding and improved ∞tly.

Eg. Kriz life path, from interpolate and extrapolate similar cases.
