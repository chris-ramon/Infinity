##### Wise
Asking questions top-down:
- What, why, how, when ? 

Eg, Universe:
- What are the smallest thing known ?
- What are the limits ?
- How everything started ?
- Why everything is connected ?
- How many are there ?

###### Strategies
Closing the GAP between what I don't know and what I know,
takes time but worths it, there is something in-between that
awakes in the brain.

###### Eg.
Learning a new language is like learning to talk again.

Languages:
Basic words, grammar, syntax
GAP - Questions & practice.
Awaking in the language in the language up-to become fluently.
